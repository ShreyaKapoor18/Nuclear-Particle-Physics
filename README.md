This code is part of an assignment done to 
find the coefficients of the Weizsacher's 
semi emperical mass formula with 
Coulomb term, Assymmetry term, 
Volume term and Delta term. 

Calculations have been performed 
in order to determine the coefficients 
of these terms respectively. 

First method employed was the curve fitting
which did not work well while the other 
method using matlab toolbox gave good 
performance with a higher R^2 value.
A high R^2 value does not necessary 
mean that the model which has been fit 
is a good model because it might 
have overfit the data. 

The results show of the errors
, if we consider parity and if 
we neglect parity.
